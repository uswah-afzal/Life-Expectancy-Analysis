# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict life expectancy in different countries. It is built using Streamlit to create an interactive web application, where users can explore how life expectancy varies across nations based on various socio-economic factors. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface to showcase predictions using a trained machine learning model.

## Features

- Predict life expectancy based on various socio-economic and health factors.
- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit.
- Machine learning model (Rando Forest Regression) to predict life expectancy.
- Visualizations to compare predictions and actual values.
